# FM Help Service

[FM Help Service](http://banks.id.au/software/fmhelpservice/index.html) is a (very) small application that places an item in the [Mac OS X services menu](http://www.macosxautomation.com/services/) to find the currently selected text in the [FileMaker Pro Help](http://www.filemaker.com/12help/).

The release version, 1.0.2, was built using Xcode 5.0.2: the code here builds on Mac OS X 10.9.
